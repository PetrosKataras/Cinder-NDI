Cinder block for Newtek's [NDI](http://newtek.com/ndi) video-over-IP protocol ( v3 ). See it in action [here](https://vimeo.com/202182941) .

Once you have Cinder setup clone the block into the blocks folder and  `cd Cinder/blocks/Cinder-NDI/samples/sampleDir/proj/cmake && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && make -j4`
